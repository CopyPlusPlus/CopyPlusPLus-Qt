This is a version of CopyPlusPlus based on Qt/C++.

Advantage: **Cross-platform**.

Disadvantage: **File size is much bigger**, from original 5 MB to 50 MB, due to the Qt library files.

But as a computer application, I think it's still acceptable. And I will also make it a single exe file, no need to install.

Besides, I will integrate more funcions into this version, like offline translation, OCR...
